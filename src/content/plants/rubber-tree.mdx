Rubber trees are a classic, and can be quickly recognized by their large, shiny leaves, which can range from lighter green to a deep burgundy color.

When pruning a leaf, a white liquid will leak out. Like most figs, _ficus elastica_ produces a toxic latex that may irritate your skin, but can be extremely dangerous if ingested by children or pets.

Rubber trees donâ€™t like to have wet feet, but they do thrive in humid environments, so give them a mist daily if needed. As always with plants that need misting, clean the topsoil of any debris to avoid fungus buildup.

The Houseplant Basics still apply:

- Cold water in summer, room temperature in winter
- Fertilize every 2 weeks, but not in winter
- Use sanitary tools when pruning
- Use gloves and paper towels when pruning toxic plants

## Propagation

Pruned branches can be kept in a jar of filtered water with the leaves sticking out of the jar. Leave the jar in direct sunlight for a month, then plant in a 70% potting soil, 20% sand, 10% perlite mixture.
