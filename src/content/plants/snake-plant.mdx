Snake plants are the embodiment of minimalism. They are easy to care for, simple in structure, and easily propagated.

Itâ€™s easy to over-water a snake plant, so err on the side of under-watering, allowing the soil to dry completely between waterings. Use a freely draining soil and ensure humidity has an escape route.

The Houseplant Basics still apply:

- Cold water in summer, room temperature in winter
- Fertilize every 2 weeks, but not in winter
- Use sanitary tools when cutting

## Propagation

Snake plants form tall, separate leaves that can be removed individually. Using a sharp knife, cut straight down into the soil around the leaf and replant in fresh soil.
